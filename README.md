"I've developed a web application called News Explorer, designed to streamline news exploration. With a user-friendly navigation bar offering categories like ipl finance politics technology , users can easily navigate to their preferred news sections. The main section presents news articles in card format, offering a snapshot of each story. Clicking on a card opens up the full article, providing an in-depth view. Additionally, have also added a search function, empowering users to input custom queries and discover news related to their interests. News Explorer is a versatile platform, delivering a seamless and personalized news exploration experience."
